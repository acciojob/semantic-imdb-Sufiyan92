			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<Summary>This movie is Based on Chetan Bhagat's novel, Five Point Someone (though only a miniscule part has
				been adapted from the book; the rest is all original), here's a story of three friends studying in an
				engineering college Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan (R Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi).
				Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Rancchoddas "Rancho" Shyamaldas Chanchad
				(Aamir Khan) are three engineering students who share a room in a hostel at the Imperial College of
				Engineering, one of the best colleges in India. While Farhan and Raju are average students from modest
				backgrounds, Rancho is from a rich family. Farhan wants to become a wildlife photographer, but has
				joined engineering college to fulfil his father's wish. Raju on the other hand wants to uplift his
				family fortunes. Rancho is a wealthy genius who studies for the sheer joy of it. However, Rancho's
				passion is for knowledge and taking apart and building machines rather than the conventional obsession
				of the other students with exam ranks. With his different approach Rancho incurs the wrath of dean of
				college, Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) (Boman Irani). Rancho irritates his lecturers by giving
				creative and unorthodox answers, and confronts ViruS after fellow student Joy Lobo hangs himself in his
				dormitory room. Joy had requested an extension on his major project on compassionate groundshis father
				had suffered a strokebut ViruS refused, saying that he himself was completely unmoved by his own son's
				accidental death after being hit by a train. Rancho denounces the rat race, dog-eat-dog, mindless rote
				learning mentality of the institution, blaming it for Lobo's death.
				Despite his fun and frolic, Rancho always surprises everyone by topping the class. He even manages to
				win the affections of the director's daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor). But Rancho's greatest contribution
				lies is making his friends realise their true calling.
				This isn't a bad film, though. By which I mean it conjures up a few moments, it will doubtless make some
				people cry, and every now and then we glimpse some heart. Yet it hurts to see that this is traditional
				Bollywood masala schlock, with scenes calculated to tickle and to evoke sympathy. It's not awful at all,
				but since when did 'not bad' become good? Dr Feelgood doesn't make the cut this time, and we need to
				measure him by the high bar his previous excellence has set -- by which degree this is a whopper of a
				disappointment.
